# NE555-multivibrator-circuit

NE555 timer-based multivibrator circuit with buzzer and LED, showcasing embedded system skills.

Type: Personal Project

Description: A simple multivibrator circuit built using the NE555 timer IC, a buzzer, pushbutton, switch, and a 9V battery. This project demonstrates basic electronics concepts, oscillating circuits, and practical hardware skills without using a microcontroller.

## Components
- NE555 Timer IC  
- Buzzer  
- 6F22 9V Battery  
- Pushbutton and Switch  
- Battery connectors, resistors, and wiring 
- LED    
- Capacitors, resistors, connecting leads and veroboard for soldering.


## Steps I Followed
1. Plan the Circuit 
   - Designed the astable multivibrator circuit using NE555 to alternate the buzzer output.  
   - Determined resistor and capacitor values for desired frequency.  

2. Assemble Components 
   - Connected the NE555 IC, buzzer, battery, switch, and pushbutton on a breadboard.  

3. Wire the Circuit 
   - Carefully wired components to match the designed schematic.  
   - Checked connections for proper voltage and continuity.  

4. Test and Debug 
   - Powered the circuit with a 9V battery.  
   - Verified the buzzer responded correctly to the switch and pushbutton.  
   - Adjusted resistor values to fine-tune the buzzer frequency.
  
## Learning Outcomes
